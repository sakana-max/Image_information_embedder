# Image_information_embedder

## Overview
This project allows you to embed any file without distorting the image.

The following image contains a text file: [The file being written(testImage/Hello.txt)](testImage/Hello.txt)
![Image file with text written on it](testImage/test.png)
### Details
Records and reads 0 and 1 according to the even and odd RGB numbers of the image. (LSB conversion)

This allows you to embed and read any file into an image.

You can also record the filename along with the file's binary, so you can automatically record the filename and extension when reading it.

*Note: If there is a file with the same name as the output file, it will be overwritten. Please be careful.
